            <abstract>
                <p>A petition to the King, dated 11 February 1531, was sent from Bristol to 
                highlight the damage being done to the town and the wider realm by the 
                selling of French caps and hats above the price mandated by statute 
                21 Henry VIII, c. 9 (1529). The act, intituled `an act limiting the prices 
                of woollen hats, bonnets and caps made beyond the sea and brought to be sold 
                within this realm', legislated that from the Purification of Our Lady 
                (2 February, 1530), no person was to sell imported woollen caps and bonnets 
                for more than two shillings, no hat above ten pence, and no night cap or crown 
                cap above six pence. Any person selling above these prices would be fined forty 
                shillings per item. <note><title>Statutes of the Realm</title>, III, p. 290. </note> Eustace 
                Chapuys, imperial ambassador to the court of Henry VIII, 
                refers to the act in correspondence to the Emperor, claiming that the Duke of 
                Norfolk brought the legislation to parliament. <note><title>Calendar of State Papers, 
                Spanish</title>, Vol. 4, Part 1, 232. Stanford E. Lehmberg noted that Chapuys `complained' 
                that the price of French caps were fixed even though they were of better quality. 
                See Stanford E. Lehmberg in <title>The Reformation Parliament 1529-1536</title> (London, 1970), p. 97, f. 3.
                However, Chapuys was framing the legislation in a positive light as an example of 
                how Norfolk favoured Spanish and Flemish trade over French.</note> An earlier act of 1512 
                (3 Henry VIII, c. 15) attempted to fix the price of domestically produced hats and limit
                the availability of imported hats to knights and nobility, with fines of forty shillings and
                the forefeiture of the hats to others. <note><title>Statutes of the Realm</title>, III, pp. 34-5l;
                see M. Hayward, <title>Rich Apparel: Clothing and the Law in Henry VIII's England</title> 
                (Farnham, 2009), p. 26.</note> The act of 1531 stated that the forefeiture would only
                extend to the sellers of foreign caps.</p>

                <p>The petition from Bristol is one of eight similar petitions from towns involved in the cap 
                and hat making trade held in the Parliamentary Archives at the Palace of 
                Westminster. <note>The petitions are from Shrewsbury, Bridgnorth, Bristol, Borough of 
                Southwark, Gloucester, Bewdley, Stafford and Lichfield and have been calendared in the
                <title>Third Report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts</title> (London, 1872), 
                p. 4. The petition from the Borough of Southwark is discussed in H. Duckworth, `The Early 
                History of Feltmaking in London 1250-1604' (June, 2013) 
                [http://www.feltmakers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Feltmakers-Research-Paper-Final-version.pdf]
                </note> The Bristol petition states that if the act was better observed then it would benefit 
                the town of Bristol since 1500 poor men, women and children derive most of their living
                from the production of hats.</p>
